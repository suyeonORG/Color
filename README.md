# How to use
Put a file called Template.min.jpg in the bin folder (where the executable is created) and start the software. The main menu will load with all the 8 filters available.
Once done, select one of the filter by clicking on it, you will notice the Main Frame will load the image with the previously selected filter. To save the image you can simply click on the Main Frame.
A SaveFileDialog will ask your to choose between three file formats currently available: Bitmap bmp, Portable Network Graphics png, JPEG jpg.

# TODO
A file browsing dialog. But hey, it's just a sample. As all Suyeon projects, you need to create your own things based on our project!
